      'Stevan was fantastic. He was very responsive to questions, laid out his plan in advance and stuck to it. Finished well ahead of schedule and on budget. Also has great communication skills and was willing to walk me through his work so I could understand how he did what he did. We will be using him again for any SharePoint development we might need.',

      'I am extremely happy with this gentleman, professional, timely delivery and responsive. While other SharePoint (pretenders) failed to finish the project on time, this resource saved the day, we were dealing with multiple issues, and he fixed all of them one by one even at wee hours. I don’t even think for a second time – hire him.',

      'Stevan was a pleasure to work with, delivering me a high quality prototype on a tight schedule. As important as the deliverable, he was easy to work with, understanding my requirements and working with me to get to the right result. I will certainly be working with him again. ',

      'I can’t recommend Stevan highly enough, for this work I had quotes of 60 hours+, he managed to complete within days. My only concern is that he’s going to be too busy to help me with other projects in the future. Thanks again Stevan!! ',
